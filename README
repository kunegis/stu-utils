These are various utilities to be used together with the Stu build
automation tool, available at

https://github.com/kunegis/stu

These tools are not to be considered official, but rather a proof of
concept.  

For now, these are programs that can be used to perform individual steps
in a Stu file.  In the long run, we will add Stu library files (*.stu)
that can be used by Stu files to achieve certain Stu patterns.
